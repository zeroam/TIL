This tutorial has three different iterations of building socket server and client with Python:
1. We'll start the tutorial by looking at a simple socket server and client
2. Once you've senn the API and how things work in this initial example, we'll look at an improved version that handles multiple connections simultaneously
3. Finally, we'll progress to building an example server and client that functions like a full-fledged socket application, complete with its own header and content
